					<li>Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) involves the referral of unresolved disputes to an independent third party for adjudication. There is no charge to you for using this service. The details of our ADR entity are also held by the Gambling Commission. The ADR entity reserves the right to reject disputes referred for resolution on the basis that they are frivolous of vexatious but we are not permitted to refuse referral on that basis. The ultimate resolution may be made binding on both parties but does not deprive you of the right to pursue the matter in the courts. Details of all disputes referred to the ADR entity and details of the outcome will be provided by us to the Gambling Commission, as required by the Licence Conditions and Codes of Practice attached to MT Secure Trade’s Operating Licence.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>TRANSFER OF RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>EVENTS OUTSIDE OUR CONTROL
					<ol>
					<li>We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under the Terms of Use that is caused by events outside our reasonable control, including, without limitation, acts of God, war, civil commotion, interruption in public communications networks or services, industrial dispute or DDOS-attacks and similar Internet attacks having an adverse effect ("Force Majeure"). Our performance is deemed to be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues, and we will have an extension of time for performance for the duration of that period. We will use our reasonable endeavors to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which our obligations may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>WAIVER
					<ol>
					<li>If we fail to insist upon strict performance of any of your obligations or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or remedies to which we are entitled, this shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies and shall not relieve you from compliance with such obligations.</li>
					<li>A waiver by us of any default shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent default. No waiver by us of any of the provisions of the Terms shall be effective unless it is expressly stated to be a waiver and is communicated to you in writing in accordance with above.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>SEVERABILITY
					<ol>
					<li>If any of the Terms are determined to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law. In such cases, the part deemed invalid or unenforceable shall be amended in a manner consistent with the applicable law to reflect, as closely as possible, our original intent.</li>
					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>LAW AND JURISDICTION
					<ol>
					<li>For GB Players the Terms of Use shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of England and Wales. For non-GB Players the Terms of Use shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Malta in the Maltese Courts.</li>

					</ol>
					</li>
					<li>RESPONSIBLE GAMING AND GAMBLING
					<ol>
					<li>We are committed to endorsing responsible gaming as a policy of customer care and social responsibility. We believe it is our responsibility to you, our customers, to ensure that you enjoy your wagering experience on our site, while remaining fully aware of the social and financial harms associated with problem gambling.</li>
					<li>Deposit Limits - In order to assist our players in gambling responsibly, we have a Deposit Limit within each customer account. This option can be accessed within Your Account. Limits can be amended at anytime. A decrease in the deposit limit will take effect immediately, but an increase can only occur after a cooling-off period, in order to avoid rash decisions. If you require any further information or assistance regarding our functionality, please contact our Customer Care.</li>
					<li>Self-exclusion (non-GB players) Should you need to take a break from gambling with this Website and all other skins and Websites operated by the licence holder, we provide a self-exclusion facility which can be activated by the customer within Your Account settings or by contacting Customer Care. Self-exclusion means that your account will remain closed for a minimum period (this minimum period is 7 days and the account will not be reactivated under any circumstances during the exclusion period). This is the major difference to a standard account closure request; time out. Excluding yourself will affect your account with this Website as well as other Websites operated under the same licence.</li>
					<li>Time Out (non-GB players) Should you need to take a time out from gambling please avail yourself to the Time Out functionality on the Website and choose the period you wish to be timed out. This tool can be found in Your Account settings. Should you for any reason be unable to impose these limits yourself please contact Customer Services. Upon the end of your Self Exclusion or Time Out period, your account will automatically be reactivated.</li>
					<li>Self-exclusion (GB players) Should you need to take a break from gambling with this Website and all other skins and Websites operated by the licence holder, MT SecureTrade Limited and Betit Operations Limited, we provide a self-exclusion facility which can be activated by the customer within Your Account settings or by contacting support. Self-exclusion means that your account will remain closed for a minimum period (this minimum period is 6 months and the account will not be reactivated under any circumstances during the exclusion period). Upon the end of your Self Exclusion your account will remain closed until you make contact with Customer Services to have your account reactivated. This can be done in the form of an e-mail or a request through our Live Chat system. This is the major difference to a standard account closure request; time out. Once you have self-excluded on the brand you are currently a member of, all Your accounts operated by both MT SecureTrade Limited and Betit Operations Limited will be closed for the self-exclusion period selected. This is in accordance with our obligations under Social Responsibility Codes.</li>
					<li>Time Out (GB players) Should you need to take a time out from gambling please avail yourself to the Time Out functionality on the Website and choose the period you wish to be timed out. This tool can be found in Your Account. Should you for any reason be unable to impose these limits yourself please contact Customer Services. Upon the end of your Time Out period, your account will automatically be reactivated.</li>
					<li>We will use our best endeavours to ensure that, if you have requested self-exclusion from our Website, you will not be able to open a new account with us or any other Website operated under the same license. However, in the event that you succeed in creating a new account by supplying false data, or via any similar means, you agree that all liability for any losses subsequently incurred as a result of using our Services will fall on you. Should we become aware that you have supplied false data, or any similar means, to open an account with us, we reserve the right to immediately close that account and retain any winnings.</li>
					<li>If you are considering self-exclusion, please remember to contact all gambling companies with whom you have accounts and ask to self-exclude with them too. We will use our reasonable endeavours to ensure compliance with your self-exclusion. However you accept that we have no responsibility or liability whatsoever if you continue gambling and/or seek to use the Website and we fail to recognise or determine that due to you providing false information. We also recommend that consideration is given to the installation of software that will allow you to block access to internet gambling Websites. See Filtering Systems at the bottom of this page.</li>
					<li>Underage Gambling - It is illegal for anyone under the age of 18 to open an account or to gamble on our Website. We carry out age Checks on all customers who use payment mechanisms which are available to under 18s and additionally perform random age Checks on customers using other forms of funding mechanisms. Please note that anyone under the age of 18 found to be using the site will have any winnings forfeited and may also be reported to the authorities.</li>
					<li>(For GB Players) In line with UK regulation, any person found to have created and/or operated an account whilst underage shall have any and all stakes refunded (less withdrawals, should there be any).</li>
					<li>Filtering Systems - Filtering solutions allow parents to regulate access to the internet, based on chosen criteria. Parents can use filters to prevent their children from accessing, amongst other things, gambling websites. If you share your computer with friends or family who are under the Legal Age to register or bet with our site, or have requested self-exclusion from gambling sites, please consider parental filtering solutions.</li>
					<li>Setting of Financial Limits – A player may set financial limits mainly related to losses by contacting our Customer Care team. Once these limits are set the player will not be able to exceed these limits.</li>
					<li>Setting of Session Time Limits – A player may set maximum Session Time Limits by contacting our Customer Care team. Once these limits are set the player will not be allowed to continue playing above the preset time limit in any one session.</li>
					<li>Any notice for changes described above will be accompanied by a seven (7) day cool down period in which the player will not be able to revert the conditions previously placed on his account.</li>
					<li>We are committed to supporting Responsible Gambling initiatives and encourage you to find information about Responsible Gambling at the websites of the following organisations: GambleAware (www.gambleaware.co.uk), GamCare (www.gamcare.org.uk), GordonHouse (www.gamblingtherapy.org), Gam-Anon (www.gamanon.org.uk) and GA (www.gamblersanonymous.org.uk).</li>
